However, most of them are not giving me a clear view or needed some HTML/CSS coding background to make some changes from the original or too expensive to have. I downloaded the copy of Tailus template which is very clear to understand at the last and you could modify the codes/blocks to fit perfectly on your purpose of the page.",
